- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmad Rouzbehani
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making ideas come to life by developing web apps. I've developed some web applications in the field of english listening practicing, Onlie Persian Calligraphy education and an online classroom for music education.
- ðŸŒ± I have experiences with building apps using ASP.NET MVC Razor, jQuery, CSS, MS SQL Server, EntityFramework and now Iâ€™m currently learning how to build web apps by .net Core and react/typescript in a cleaner architectural way.
